    subtitle: "Hello, I am Hadrien! I come from Paris, France, where I did most of my education, as well as my undergraduate studies in economics. Afterwards, I did a Masters in Management in Bordeaux, and was involved in my schoolâ€™s student-led consultancy. After some internships in financial controlling and audit, I decided to join the MFA to further my knowledge in finance. I like music, especially funk, soul, and jazz. I also do a lot of sport and like very much physical exercise. Finally, I enjoy reading about politics and economics. Do not hesitate to reach out!"
