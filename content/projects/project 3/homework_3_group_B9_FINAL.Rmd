# Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance

Every two years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conduct the [Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/index.htm) survey, where it takes data from high schoolers (9th through 12th grade), to analyze health patterns. You will work with a selected group of variables from a random sample of observations during one of the years the YRBSS was conducted.

## Load the data

This data is part of the `openintro` textbook and we can load and inspect it. There are observations on 13 different variables, some categorical and some numerical. The meaning of each variable can be found by bringing up the help file:

?yrbss

```{r load the data, cache=TRUE}
data(yrbss)
glimpse(yrbss)
```

Before you carry on with your analysis, it's is always a good idea to check with `skimr::skim()` to get a feel for missing values, summary statistics of numerical variables, and a very rough histogram.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

You will first start with analyzing the `weight` of participants in kilograms. Using visualization and summary statistics, describe the distribution of weights. How many observations are we missing weights from?

```{r eda_on_weight, cache=TRUE}

glimpse(yrbss)
skim(yrbss) # 1004 weight entries missing

weight_analysis <- yrbss %>% 
  
  #select the weight variable
  select(weight) %>%
  
  #remove NAs
  na.omit() %>% 
  
#plot the histogram
ggplot(aes(x=weight))+
  geom_histogram(bins=30)+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title="Distribution of weights")

#print our histogram
weight_analysis
```

Next, consider the possible relationship between a high schooler’s weight and their physical activity. Plotting the data is a useful first step because it helps us quickly visualize trends, identify strong associations, and develop research questions.

Let’s create a new variable in the dataframe `yrbss`, called `physical_3plus` , which will be `yes` if they are physically active for at least 3 days a week, and `no` otherwise. You may also want to calculate the number and % of those who are and are not active for more than 3 days. RUse the `count()` function and see if you get the same results as `group_by()... summarise()`

  
```{r mutate_and_count, cache=TRUE}
# Scatterplotting relationship between a high schooler’s weight and their physical activity

yrbss_new<- yrbss %>% 
  
  #omit the NAs
  na.omit(weight,physically_active_7d) %>% 
  
  #group by physically active
  group_by(physically_active_7d)%>%
  
  #create a column for the mean weight
  mutate(mean_weight = mean(weight)) 

ggplot(yrbss_new,aes(y=weight, x=physically_active_7d))+
  
  #create a box plot
  geom_boxplot(aes(group=as.character(physically_active_7d))) + 
  theme_bw()+
  
  #add proper labels
  labs(title="Plotting relationship between a high\nschooler’s weight and their physical activity",
       x="physical active days",
       y="weight")+
  theme(plot.title=element_text(size=15,face="bold",hjust=0.5))

#plot relationship between a high schooler’s weight and their physical activity by geom_col
yrbss_new%>% 
  group_by(physically_active_7d) 

#create a new box plot with the mean weight
ggplot(yrbss_new,aes(y=mean_weight, x=physically_active_7d)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="summary", fun.y="mean")+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title="Plotting relationship between a high\nschooler’s weight and their physical activity",
       x="physical active days",
       y="mean_weight")+
  theme(plot.title=element_text(size=15,face="bold",hjust=0.5))

#create a new dataframe that contains a new column to determine the persons that are physically active
yrbss_new<-yrbss_new %>%
  na.omit(weight,physically_active_7d) %>% 
  mutate(physical_3plus=ifelse(physically_active_7d>=3, "yes", "no"), weight_count=count(weight)) %>% 
  group_by(physical_3plus) 
  ggplot(yrbss_new,aes(y=weight_count, x=physical_3plus))+
  geom_col()+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title="Weight count versus physical activity")+
  theme(plot.title=element_text(size=15,face="bold",hjust=0.5))
  
#create a new dataframe to count the persons that are physically active and the proportion of physically active persons
weight_exercise <- yrbss_new %>% 
  na.omit(weight,physically_active_7d) %>% 
  select(physical_3plus,weight) %>% 
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>% 
  summarize(num_physical=count(physical_3plus)) %>%
  mutate(sum=sum(num_physical),per_physical=num_physical/sum)%>%
  select(physical_3plus,num_physical,per_physical)
weight_exercise
```
Can you provide a 95% confidence interval for the population proportion of high schools that are *NOT* active 3 or more days per week?

```{r confidence_interval_for_population_proportion, cache=TRUE}
total_pop<-2656+5695
prop.test(2656,total_pop,0.95)
```


--> OUR ANSWER BELOW <---

As shown in Chunk 6, sample proportion is 0.318 and n is 8351 giving us a SE of 0.0051 and t-score (z-score) of 1.96.
Thus the Confidence Interval for the population proportion of high schools that are NOT active 3 or more days per week is (0.308,0.328).

--> END OF OUR ANSWER <---
  
Make a boxplot of `physical_3plus` vs. `weight`. Is there a relationship between these two variables? What did you expect and why?

```{r boxplot, cache=TRUE}

#create a boxplot of "physical_3plus" vs "weight"
yrbss_boxplot <-yrbss_new
ggplot(yrbss_new,aes(x=weight, y=physical_3plus))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title="Variable physical_3plus\nvs variable weight")+
  theme(plot.title=element_text(size=15,face="bold",hjust=0.5))

#create variable to determine the physically active persons and omit the NAs
weight_exercise_plot <- yrbss %>% 
  mutate(physical_3plus=ifelse(physically_active_7d>=3, "yes", "no")) %>% 
  na.omit(weight,physically_active_7d)

```

## Confidence Interval

Boxplots show how the medians of the two distributions compare, but we can also compare the means of the distributions using either a confidence interval or a hypothesis test. Note that when we calculate the mean, SD, etc. weight in these groups using the mean function, we must ignore any missing values by setting the `na.rm = TRUE`.


```{r ci_using_formulas, cache=TRUE}

#create a new dataframe and group by physical_3plus
ci_weight_exercise_count<-yrbss_new %>%
  
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>%
  
  #create the statistics we want to analyse
  summarize(mean=mean(weight),
            median=median(weight,na.rm=TRUE),
            sd=sd(weight),
                  count=n(),
                  se=sd/sqrt(count),
            max=max(weight),
            min=min(weight),
            t_critical=qt(0.975,count-1),
            margin_of_error=t_critical*se,
            lower_ci_95=mean-t_critical*se,
            higher_ci_95=mean+t_critical*se)

#print the statistics
ci_weight_exercise_count
            
```

There is an observed difference of about 1.77kg (68.44 - 66.67), and we notice that the two confidence intervals do not overlap. It seems that the difference is at least 95% statistically significant. Let us also conduct a hypothesis test.

## Hypothesis test with formula

Write the null and alternative hypotheses for testing whether mean weights are different for those who exercise at least times a week and those who don’t.



```{r t_test_using_R, cache=TRUE}

#create variable to determine the physically active persons
yrbss<- yrbss %>%
  mutate(physical_3plus=ifelse(physically_active_7d>=3, "yes", "no"))

#run the t-test between weight and physical_3plus
t.test(weight ~ physical_3plus, data = yrbss)
```



## Hypothesis test with `infer`


Next, we will introduce a new function, `hypothesize`, that falls into the infer workflow. You will use this method for conducting hypothesis tests.

But first, we need to initialize the test, which we will save as `obs_diff`.

```{r calc_obs_difference, cache=TRUE}

#create a dataframe to compute the difference of means
obs_diff <- yrbss %>%
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("yes", "no"))
obs_diff

```



Notice how you can use the functions specify and calculate again like you did for calculating confidence intervals. Here, though, the statistic you are searching for is the difference in means, with the order being yes - no != 0.

After you have initialized the test, you need to simulate the test on the null distribution, which we will save as null.


```{r hypothesis_testing_using_infer_package, cache=TRUE}

null_dist <- yrbss %>%
  
  # specify variables
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  
  # assume independence, i.e, there is no difference
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  
  # generate 1000 reps, of type "permute"
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  
  # calculate statistic of difference, namely "diff in means"
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("yes", "no"))

null_dist

```


Here, `hypothesize` is used to set the null hypothesis as a test for independence, i.e., that there is no difference between the two population means. In one sample cases, the null argument can be set to *point* to test a hypothesis relative to a point estimate.

Also, note that the `type` argument within generate is set to permute, which is the argument when generating a null distribution for a hypothesis test.

We can visualize this null distribution with the following code:

```{r visualize distribution, cache=TRUE}
ggplot(data = null_dist, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=30)+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title="Null distribution")+
  theme(plot.title=element_text(size=15,face="bold",hjust=0.5))

```


Now that the test is initialized and the null distribution formed, we can visualise to see how many of these null permutations have a difference of at least "obs_stat" of "r obs_diff %>% pull() %>% round(2)"?

We can also calculate the p-value for your hypothesis test using the function `infer::get_p_value()`.

```{r p-value computing, cache=TRUE}

#compute the p_value for the observed statistics
null_dist %>% visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two-sided")

null_dist %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two_sided")

```


This the standard workflow for performing hypothesis tests.

# IMDB ratings: Differences between directors

Recall the IMBD ratings data. I would like you to explore whether the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same or not. I have already calculated the confidence intervals for the mean ratings of these two directors and as you can see they overlap. 


```{r directors, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "directors.png"), error = FALSE)
```

First, I would like you to reproduce this graph. You may find `geom_errorbar()` and `geom_rect()` useful.

In addition, you will run a hpothesis test. You should use both the `t.test` command and the `infer` package to simulate from a null distribution, where you assume zero difference between the two.

> Before anything, write down the null and alternative hypotheses, as well as the resulting test statistic and the associated t-stat or p-value. At the end of the day, what do you conclude?

--> OUR ANSWER BELOW <---

Null Hypothesis- both Spielberg and Burton have the same mean rating.
Alternative Hypothesis- Spielberg and Burton have the distinct mean ratings.
p-value- /alpha=0.05

# Omega Group plc- Pay Discrimination


At the last board meeting of Omega Group Plc., the headquarters of a large multinational company, the issue was raised that women were being discriminated in the company, in the sense that the salaries were not the same for male and female executives. A quick analysis of a sample of 50 employees (of which 24 men and 26 women) revealed that the average salary for men was about 8,700 higher than for women. This seemed like a considerable difference, so it was decided that a further analysis of the company salaries was warranted. 

You are asked to carry out the analysis. The objective is to find out whether there is indeed a significant difference between the salaries of men and women, and whether the difference is due to discrimination or whether it is based on another, possibly valid, determining factor. 

## Loading the data


```{r load_omega_data, cache=TRUE}
omega <- read_csv(here::here("data", "omega.csv"))
glimpse(omega) # examine the data frame
skim(omega)
```

## Relationship Salary - Gender ?

The data frame `omega`  contains the salaries for the sample of 50 executives in the company. Can you conclude that there is a significant difference between the salaries of the male and female executives?

Note that you can perform different types of analyses, and check whether they all lead to the same conclusion 

.	Confidence intervals
.	Hypothesis testing
.	Correlation analysis
.	Regression


Calculate summary statistics on salary by gender. Also, create and print a dataframe where, for each gender, you show the mean, SD, sample size, the t-critical, the SE, the margin of error, and the low/high endpoints of a 95% condifence interval

```{r confint_single_valiables, cache=TRUE}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
mosaic::favstats (salary ~ gender, data=omega)


# Dataframe with two rows (male-female) and having as columns gender, mean, SD, sample size, 
# the t-critical value, the standard error, the margin of error, 
# and the low/high endpoints of a 95% condidence interval

#create a new dataframe
omega_new<- omega %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  
  #compute the statistics we want to analyse
  summarize(mean_salary=mean(salary),
         sd_salary=sd(salary),
         sample_size=n(),
         t_critical=qt(0.975,sample_size-1),
         se_salary=sd_salary/sqrt(sample_size),
         margin_of_error=t_critical*se_salary,
         lower_ci_95=mean_salary-t_critical*se_salary,
         higher_ci_95=mean_salary+t_critical*se_salary)

#print our statistics table
omega_new
```

> What can you conclude from your analysis? A couple of sentences would be enough

--> OUR ANSWER BELOW <--

The salaries of the male executives are around 15% more than female supported by min,median,max, and mean numbers.Additionally, the CIs do not overlap and the t_critical also >2, which can be clearly concluded that there is a different between the salary payment. 

--> END OF OUR ANSWER <--

You can also run a hypothesis testing, assuming as a null hypothesis that the mean difference in salaries is zero, or that, on average, men and women make the same amount of money. You should tun your hypothesis testing using `t.test()` and with the simulation method from the `infer` package.

```{r hypothesis_testing, cache=TRUE}
# hypothesis testing using t.test() 
omega<- omega %>%
  na.omit()

#do a t-test
t.test(salary ~ gender ,data=omega)

#using infer package
gender_salary_diff <- omega %>%
  na.omit()%>%
  specify(salary ~ gender) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means",order= c("male", "female"))

null_dist_salary <- omega %>%
  na.omit()%>%
  
  #specify variables
  specify(salary ~ gender) %>%
  
  #assume independence, i.e, there is no difference
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  
  #generate 2000 reps, of type "permute"
  generate(reps = 2000, type = "permute") %>%
  
  # alculate statistic of difference, namely "diff in means"
  calculate(stat = "diff in means",order=  c("male", "female"))

#plot the histogram
ggplot(data = null_dist_salary, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30)+
  labs(title="Null salary distribution")+
  theme(plot.title=element_text(size=15,face="bold",hjust=0.5))

#compute the p-value
null_dist_salary %>% 
  visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = gender_salary_diff, direction = "two-sided")

null_dist_salary %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = gender_salary_diff, direction = "two_sided")

```

> What can you conclude from your analysis? A couple of sentences would be enough

P-values calculated from hypothesis testing and t.test() are totally the same. 
From hypothesis testing's outcome, we can reject the null hypothesis and draw a conclusion that there is a statistically significant difference in average salaries between male and female, as indicated by a fully negative confidence interval.
The conclusion is supported by a small p-value of 0.0002 and t = -4, larger than critical value of 2.01 for 48 degrees of freedom. 


## Relationship Experience - Gender?

At the board meeting, someone raised the issue that there was indeed a substantial difference between male and female salaries, but that this was attributable to other reasons such as differences in experience. A questionnaire send out to the 50 executives in the sample reveals that the average experience of the men is approximately 21 years, whereas the women only have about 7 years experience on average (see table below).

```{r experience_stats, cache=TRUE}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
favstats (experience ~ gender, data=omega)
t.test (experience ~ gender, data=omega)
cor(omega$salary,omega$experience)
```

Based on this evidence, can you conclude that there is a significant difference between the experience of the male and female executives? Perform similar analyses as in the previous section. Does your conclusion validate or endanger your conclusion about the difference in male and female salaries?  

--> OUR ANSWER BELOW <--

We can conclude that there is a significant difference between the experience of the male and female executives. In also completing a t-test, we can see that this difference is statistically significant. This discovery endangers our conclusions about salary since we can see a high correlation between experience and salary, implying the two variables are not independent, and thus our conclusion about gender bias is skewed since we haven't normalised with respect to experience.

--> END OF OUR ANSWER <---

## Relationship Salary - Experience ?

Someone at the meeting argues that clearly, a more thorough analysis of the relationship between salary and experience is required before any conclusion can be drawn about whether there is any gender-based salary discrimination in the company.

Analyse the relationship between salary and experience. Draw a scatterplot to visually inspect the data


```{r salary_exp_scatter, cache=TRUE}

#plot the graph
ggplot(omega, aes(x=experience, y = salary,colour = gender))+
  geom_point()+ 
  
  #rescale our axes for increased readability
  scale_x_continuous()+
  scale_y_log10()+
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Salary by experience of male and female ",
    subtitle= "scatterplot showing the samples",
    x="year of experience",
    y="salary")+
  theme(plot.title=element_text(size=15,face="bold"),
        axis.title=element_text(size=12, face="bold"))+
  NULL

```


## Check correlations between the data
You can use `GGally:ggpairs()` to create a scatterplot and correlation matrix. Essentially, we change the order our variables will appear in and have the dependent variable (Y), salary, as last in our list. We then pipe the dataframe to `ggpairs()` with `aes` arguments to colour by `gender` and make ths plots somewhat transparent (`alpha  = 0.3`).

```{r ggpairs, cache=TRUE}
omega %>% 
  #order the variables that will appear in ggpairs()
  select(gender, experience, salary) %>% 
  ggpairs(aes(colour=gender, alpha = 0.3))+
  theme_bw()
```

> Look at the salary vs experience scatterplot. What can you infer from this plot? Explain in a couple of sentences

According to the plots,they show that with the same experiences i.e. between 15-30 years, the salary paid to male is more than women.The salary gap is around 15% according to the median. 
Female also have higher correlation of 0.812 between salary and experience more than male of 0.661 showing that women tend to pay according to the year of experience while for male,the salary paid and experience are less related.

# Challenge 1: Yield Curve inversion

Every so often, we hear warnings from commentators on the "inverted yield curve" and its predictive power with respect to recessions. An explainer what a [inverted yield curve is can be found here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-yieldcurve-explainer/explainer-what-is-an-inverted-yield-curve-idUSKBN1O50GA). If you'd rather listen to something, here is a great podcast from [NPR on yield curve indicators](https://www.podbean.com/media/share/dir-4zgj9-6aefd11)

In addition, many articles and commentators think that, e.g., [*Yield curve inversion is viewed as a harbinger of recession*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-14/u-k-yield-curve-inverts-for-first-time-since-financial-crisis). One can always doubt whether inversions are truly a harbinger of recessions, and [use the attached parable on yield curve inversions](https://twitter.com/5_min_macro/status/1161627360946511873).


```{r yield_curve_parable.jpg, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", cache=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve_parable.jpg"), error = FALSE)
```


In our case we will look at US data and use the [FRED database](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) to download historical yield curve rates, and plot the yield curves since 1999 to see when the yield curves flatten. If you want to know more, a very nice article that explains the [yield curve is and its inversion can be found here](https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2018/10/the-data-behind-the-fear-of-yield-curve-inversions/). At the end of this challenge you should produce this chart

```{r yield_curve_challenge, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", cache=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve_challenge.png"), error = FALSE)
```


First, we will load the yield curve data file that contains data on the yield curve since 1960-01-01

```{r download_historical_yield_curve, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

yield_curve <- read_csv(here::here("data", "yield_curve.csv"))

glimpse(yield_curve)
```

Our dataframe `yield_curve` has five columns (variables):

- `date`: already a date object
- `series_id`: the FRED database ticker symbol
- `value`: the actual yield on that date
- `maturity`: a short hand for the maturity of the bond
- `duration`: the duration, written out in all its glory!


## Plotting the yield curve

This may seem long but it should be easy to produce the following three plots

### Yields on US rates by duration since 1960

```{r yield_curve_1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", cache=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve1.png"), error = FALSE)

yield_curve %>%

#plot the graph
ggplot(aes(x=date, y=value, colour=duration))+
  
  #create a ligne graph and remove the legend
  geom_line(show.legend = FALSE)+
  
  #facet by maturity using the order we defined above and set the number of column per row to 2

ggplot(aes(x=maturity, y=value, color=year))+
  
  #create a line graph, group by month and remove the legend 
  geom_line(aes(group=month),show.legend = FALSE)+
  
  #color the year with rainbow colours
  scale_color_gradientn(colors = rainbow(23))+
  
  #facet by year and set the column number to 4

         year=year(date),
         month=month(date)) %>%
  
  #filter for the year after 1999 and the maturities we are interested in
  filter(year>=1999,
         duration%in% c("3-Month Treasury Bill","10-Year Treasury Rate"))

yield_curve_2bis %>%

According to [Wikipedia's list of recession in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States), since 1999 there have been two recession in the US: between Mar 2001–Nov 2001 and between Dec 2007–June 2009. Does the yield curve seem to flatten before these recessions? Can a yield curve flattening really mean a recession is coming in the US? Since 1999, when did short-term (3 months) yield more than longer term (10 years) debt?

--> OUR ANSWER BELOW <--

The yield curve seems to flatten before the recession, and this can indicate a recession as can be clearly seen on the graphs during 1999 – 2000 and 2005 - 2006. There is a smaller yield differential between short and long-term debt, an anticipation of tighter monetary policy and economic uncertainty. Short-term yield was more than long term debt during August 2000 – December 2000 and August 2006 to April 2007.

--> END OF OUR ANSWER <--

Besides calculating the spread (10year - 3months), there are a few things we need to do to produce our final plot

1. Setup data for US recessions 
1. Superimpose recessions as the grey areas in our plot
1. Plot the spread between 30 years and 3 months as a blue/red ribbon, based on whether the spread is positive (blue) or negative(red)

- For the first, the code below creates a dataframe with all US recessions since 1946

```{r setup_US-recessions, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

# get US recession dates after 1946 from Wikipedia 
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States

```

- To add the grey shaded areas corresponding to recessions, we use `geom_rect()`
- to colour the ribbons blue/red we must see whether the spread is positive or negative and then use `geom_ribbon()`. You should be familiar with this from last week's homework on the excess weekly/monthly rentals of Santander Bikes in London.

# Challenge 2: GDP components over time and among countries

At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the [Wikipedia GDP page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product).

The GDP data we will look at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP. The file we will work with is [GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6) and it has already been saved in the Data directory. Have a look at the Excel file to see how it is structured and organised


```{r read_GDP_data, cache=TRUE}

UN_GDP_data  <- read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip

```

The first thing you need to do is to tidy the data, as it is in wide format and you must make it into long, tidy format. Please express all figures in billions (divide values by `1e9`, or $10^9$), and you want to rename the indicators into something shorter.

```{r reshape_GDP_data, cache=TRUE}

#convert the data to long format
tidy_GDP_data  <-  pivot_longer(UN_GDP_data, cols = 4:51, #using the the columns 4 to 51 to make a long table
                                names_to = "Years",
                                values_to = "Values") 
                
#clean the data - values to billions, set the variables properly and rename indicators
tidy_GDP_data<- tidy_GDP_data %>% 
  mutate(Values=Values/10^9) %>%
  mutate(across(Years,as.numeric)) %>% #set "Years" as a numeric variable
  mutate(across(Country,as.character)) %>%
  rename(Indicator=IndicatorName) 

#check which indicators and countries to change
tidy_GDP_data %>% distinct(Indicator)
tidy_GDP_data %>% distinct(Country)

#we get an error message when recoding in pipe, so we use base R based on suggestions from StackOverFlow 
#the error we get is <<Error in UseMethod("recode") : no applicable method for 'recode' applied to an object of class "c('tbl_df', 'tbl', 'data.frame')">>

#rename the indicators using the recode function
tidy_GDP_data$Indicator <- recode(tidy_GDP_data$Indicator,

tidy_GDP_data <- tidy_GDP_data %>% 
  select("Country", "Indicator", "Years", "Values")

# Let us compare GDP components for these 3 countries

#creat a data frame filtered with the vector containing the three countries we want to compare
tidy_GDP_data_3 <- tidy_GDP_data %>%
  filter(Country %in% country_list)
```

First, can you produce this plot?


```{r gdp1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", cache=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gdp1.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r gdp1_plot, cache=TRUE, out.width="100%"}

#create the vector of the indicators we want 
indicator_list_1 <- c("Gross capital formation", "Exports", "Government expenditure", "Household expenditure", "Imports")

#selecting our tidy data frame that has been filtered for the Germany, India and the US
tidy_GDP_data_3 %>%
  
  #filter the indicators with the vector we created
  filter(Indicator %in% indicator_list_1) %>%
  
  #plot the graph with the right aesthetics
  ggplot(aes(x = Years, y = Values, colour = Indicator))+
  
  #group by indicator
  geom_line(aes(group=Indicator))+
  
  #facet by country and set the column number to 3
  facet_wrap(~Country,ncol=3)+
  
  #set the proper theme, titles and caption
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title="GDP components over time",
       subtitle = "In constant 2010 USD",
       color = "Components of  GDP",
       y="Billion US$",
       x="")
```

Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption *C*), Gross Capital Formation (business investment *I*), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator `Gross Domestic Product (GDP)` in your dataframe, I would like you to calculate it given its components discussed above.

            higher_ci_95=mean_change_US+t_critical*se_change_US)

#print the differences
diff_germany
diff_india
diff_US
```

From the above, we can see an average difference of 1.11% for Germany, 0.08% for India, and 1.24% for the US, which implies that either the governments typically released underestimates, or we are lacking additional data that would cause such consistent errors.

--> OUR ANSWER BELOW <--

Regarding Germany, household expenditure contributes the most to the Country’s GDP during 1970 to 2016 followed by exports and imports. The government expenditure and gross capital formation reported the same trends with a very small growth during the period. Concerning India, household expenditure also accounts the most of its GDP and showed an increasing trend since 1970.  Other contributors reported flat trends during 1970 to 2000 and started to grow after that. The U.S.’s GDP reported a substantially growth comparing to the other two countries especially on household expenditures that increased almost five times during the periods.

# Rubric

Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. 

Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). 

Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output.
