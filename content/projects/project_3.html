<div id="opinion-polls-for-the-2021-german-elections" class="section level1">
<h1>Opinion polls for the 2021 German elections</h1>
<p>The goal is to create a chart that synthesizes the opinion polls for the 2021 German election, such as the one <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/20/german-election-poll-tracker-who-will-be-the-next-chancellor">the one</a> created by the Guardian newspaper.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Scraping the data from the Wikipedia page</strong></p>
<p>We scrape the wikipedia page and import the table in a dataframe.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>url &lt;- &quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2021_German_federal_election&quot;

# similar graphs and analyses can be found at 
# https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/21/german-election-poll-tracker-who-will-be-the-next-chancellor
# https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/who-will-succeed-angela-merkel


# get tables that exist on wikipedia page 
tables &lt;- url %&gt;% 
  read_html() %&gt;% 
  html_nodes(css=&quot;table&quot;)


# parse HTML tables into a dataframe called polls 
# Use purr::map() to create a list of all tables in URL
polls &lt;- map(tables, . %&gt;% 
             html_table(fill=TRUE)%&gt;% 
             janitor::clean_names())


# list of opinion polls
german_election_polls &lt;- polls[[1]] %&gt;% # the first table on the page contains the list of all opinions polls
  slice(2:(n()-1)) %&gt;%  # drop the first row, as it contains again the variable names and last row that contains 2017 results
  mutate(
         # polls are shown to run from-to, e.g. 9-13 Aug 2021. We keep the last date, 13 Aug here, as the poll date
         # and we extract it by picking the last 11 characters from that field
         end_date = str_sub(fieldwork_date, -11),
         
         # end_date is still a string, so we convert it into a date object using lubridate::dmy()
         end_date = dmy(end_date),
         
         # we also get the month and week number from the date, if we want to do analysis by month- week, etc.
         month = month(end_date),
         week = isoweek(end_date)
         )</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 2: Building the Chart</strong></p>
<p>Then, we create the chart with the data scrapped from Wikipedia.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(plotly)
#To be able to plot all the German parties&#39; polling scores on the y axis by date, we need to rework our data set so as to have the date as a function of all the parties&#39; polling score. To to this, we first have to define variables for each party&#39; polling score.
SPD &lt;- german_election_polls$spd
Union &lt;- german_election_polls$union
AfD &lt;- german_election_polls$af_d
FDP &lt;- german_election_polls$fdp
Linke &lt;- german_election_polls$linke
Grune &lt;- german_election_polls$grune
day &lt;- german_election_polls$end_date

df1 &lt;- data.frame(SPD, Union, AfD, FDP, Linke, Grune, day) #We create a new data frame to which we assign all the variables we created.
df2 &lt;- melt(df1, id.vars=&#39;day&#39;) #Then, we melt all the parties&#39; polling scores and keep the date as the other variable.
head(df2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##          day variable value
## 1 2021-09-26      SPD  25.7
## 2 2021-09-24      SPD  25.5
## 3 2021-09-23      SPD  26.0
## 4 2021-09-23      SPD  25.0
## 5 2021-09-23      SPD  25.0
## 6 2021-09-23      SPD  26.0</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(df2,aes(x = day, y = value, colour = variable)) + #We plot the days and the parties&#39; polling scores. We colour the parties to be able to differentiate them.
  geom_point(shape=1) + #We make the points hollow to be able to better see the rolling average we&#39;ll create.
  geom_ma(spd_MA= SMA, n=14, linetype = 1, size=1) + #We create a 14-day rolling average following the Guardian&#39;s methodology. We change the linetype to a solid one so that it is more easily readable.
theme_bw()+
labs(
  title = &quot;Polling scores for the German election&quot;,
  x = &quot;Day (2021)&quot;,
  y = &quot;German parties&#39; polling scores&quot;,
)+
#Finally, we format the main title, the axes&#39; titles and the axes&#39; text to make the chart more easily readable.
theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = &quot;bold&quot;)) +
theme(axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12, angle = 0)) +
theme(axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12, angle = 90)) +
  NULL</code></pre>

<p><strong>Final output</strong></p>
<p>We obtained the synthesis of opinion polls for the 2021 German election. As the polls predicted, Olaf Scholz’ SPD and Armin Laschet’s CDU were very close, and the SPD won by a small margin.</p>
