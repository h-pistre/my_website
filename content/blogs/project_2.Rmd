# GDP components over time and among countries

The main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the [Wikipedia GDP page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product).

The GDP data we will look at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP. The file we will work with is [GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6).


```{r read_GDP_data, cache=TRUE}

UN_GDP_data  <- read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip

```

The first thing we need to do is to tidy the data, as it is in wide format and you must make it into long, tidy format.

```{r reshape_GDP_data, cache=TRUE}

#convert the data to long format
tidy_GDP_data  <-  pivot_longer(UN_GDP_data, cols = 4:51, #using the the columns 4 to 51 to make a long table
                                names_to = "Years",
                                values_to = "Values") 
                
#clean the data - values to billions, set the variables properly and rename indicators
tidy_GDP_data<- tidy_GDP_data %>% 
  mutate(Values=Values/10^9) %>%
  mutate(across(Years,as.numeric)) %>% #set "Years" as a numeric variable
  mutate(across(Country,as.character)) %>%
  rename(Indicator=IndicatorName) 

#check which indicators and countries to change
tidy_GDP_data %>% distinct(Indicator)
tidy_GDP_data %>% distinct(Country)

#we get an error message when recoding in pipe, so we use base R based on suggestions from StackOverFlow 
#the error we get is <<Error in UseMethod("recode") : no applicable method for 'recode' applied to an object of class "c('tbl_df', 'tbl', 'data.frame')">>

#rename the indicators using the recode function

```

**GDP computation differences**

The GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption *C*), Gross Capital Formation (business investment *I*), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Let us calculate the total GDP given its components discussed above and calculate the % difference between what we calculated as GDP and the GDP figure included in the dataframe.

#print the differences

```

From the above, we can see an average difference of 1.11% for Germany, 0.08% for India, and 1.24% for the US, which implies that either the governments typically released underestimates, or we are lacking additional data that would cause such consistent errors.

Regarding Germany, household expenditure contributes the most to the Country’s GDP during 1970 to 2016 followed by exports and imports. The government expenditure and gross capital formation reported the same trends with a very small growth during the period. Concerning India, household expenditure also accounts the most of its GDP and showed an increasing trend since 1970.  Other contributors reported flat trends during 1970 to 2000 and started to grow after that. The U.S.’s GDP reported a substantially growth comparing to the other two countries especially on household expenditures that increased almost five times during the periods.

**Conclusion**

As we have seen thanks to the plots we produced, the contribution of GDP component to the total GDP of each country vary, depending on their economic structures.
