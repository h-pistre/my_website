<h1>What has been my journey so far</h1>
<p><strong>What I did before LBS</strong></p>
<p>Hello, my name is Hadrien. I am from Paris, France, in which I spent most of my life. After high school school, I did a <em>Classe Pr√©paratoire</em> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classe_pr%C3%A9paratoire_aux_grandes_%C3%A9coles">preparatory class</a>) which is a two-year intensive program to enter French business schools. I subsequently joined a business school in Bordeaux. During my studies in France, I did two internships: the first one at <strong>EY Paris</strong> as a financial auditor, and the second one in a consultancy in Paris as a financial consultant.</p>
<p><strong>Why I joinded LBS</strong></p>
<p>I joined <strong>LBS</strong> to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strengthen my knowledge in finance ;</li>
<li>Have a multicutlural experience ;</li>
<li>Work in the finance industry in the UK.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My hobbies</strong></p>
<p>I like music, especially funk, soul, and jazz. I also do a lot of sport and like very much physical exercise. Finally, I enjoy reading about politics and economics. Do not hesitate to reach out!</p>
