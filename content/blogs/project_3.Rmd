# Synthesis of election polls for the 2021 German election

The goal is to create a chart that synthesizes the opinion polls for the 2021 German election, such as the one [the one](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/20/german-election-poll-tracker-who-will-be-the-next-chancellor) created by the Guardian newspaper.

**Step 1: Scraping the data from the Wikipedia page**

We scrape the wikipedia page and import the table in a dataframe.


```{r scrape_wikipedia_polling_data, warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2021_German_federal_election"

# similar graphs and analyses can be found at 
# https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/21/german-election-poll-tracker-who-will-be-the-next-chancellor
# https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/who-will-succeed-angela-merkel


# get tables that exist on wikipedia page 
tables <- url %>% 
  read_html() %>% 
  html_nodes(css="table")


# parse HTML tables into a dataframe called polls 
# Use purr::map() to create a list of all tables in URL
polls <- map(tables, . %>% 
             html_table(fill=TRUE)%>% 
             janitor::clean_names())


# list of opinion polls
german_election_polls <- polls[[1]] %>% # the first table on the page contains the list of all opinions polls
  slice(2:(n()-1)) %>%  # drop the first row, as it contains again the variable names and last row that contains 2017 results
  mutate(
         # polls are shown to run from-to, e.g. 9-13 Aug 2021. We keep the last date, 13 Aug here, as the poll date
         # and we extract it by picking the last 11 characters from that field
         end_date = str_sub(fieldwork_date, -11),
         
         # end_date is still a string, so we convert it into a date object using lubridate::dmy()
         end_date = dmy(end_date),
         
         # we also get the month and week number from the date, if we want to do analysis by month- week, etc.
         month = month(end_date),
         week = isoweek(end_date)
         )
```

**Step 2: Building the Chart**

Then, we create the chart with the data scrapped from Wikipedia.

```{r making_challenge_2_plot, warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
library(plotly)
#To be able to plot all the German parties' polling scores on the y axis by date, we need to rework our data set so as to have the date as a function of all the parties' polling score. To to this, we first have to define variables for each party' polling score.
SPD <- german_election_polls$spd
Union <- german_election_polls$union
AfD <- german_election_polls$af_d
FDP <- german_election_polls$fdp
Linke <- german_election_polls$linke
Grune <- german_election_polls$grune
day <- german_election_polls$end_date

df1 <- data.frame(SPD, Union, AfD, FDP, Linke, Grune, day) #We create a new data frame to which we assign all the variables we created.
df2 <- melt(df1, id.vars='day') #Then, we melt all the parties' polling scores and keep the date as the other variable.
head(df2)

ggplot(df2,aes(x = day, y = value, colour = variable)) + #We plot the days and the parties' polling scores. We colour the parties to be able to differentiate them.
  geom_point(shape=1) + #We make the points hollow to be able to better see the rolling average we'll create.
  geom_ma(spd_MA= SMA, n=14, linetype = 1, size=1) + #We create a 14-day rolling average following the Guardian's methodology. We change the linetype to a solid one so that it is more easily readable.
theme_bw()+
labs(
  title = "Polling scores for the German election",
  x = "Day (2021)",
  y = "German parties' polling scores",
)+
#Finally, we format the main title, the axes' titles and the axes' text to make the chart more easily readable.
theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold")) +
theme(axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12, angle = 0)) +
theme(axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12, angle = 90)) +
  NULL
```

**Conclusion**

We obtained the synthesis of opinion polls for the 2021 German election. As the polls predicted, Olaf Scholz' SPD and Armin Laschet's CDU were very close, and the SPD won by a small margin.
