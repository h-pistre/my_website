# About me

**What I did before LBS**

Hello, my name is Hadrien. I am from Paris, France, in which I spent most of my life. After high school school, I did a *Classe Pr√©paratoire* ([preparatory class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classe_pr%C3%A9paratoire_aux_grandes_%C3%A9coles)) which is a two-year intensive program to enter French business schools. I subsequently joined a business school in Bordeaux. During my studies in France, I did two internships: the first one at **EY Paris** as a financial auditor, and the second one in a consultancy in Paris as a financial consultant. 

**Why I joinded LBS**

I joined **LBS** to:

* Strengthen my knowledge in finance ;
* Have a multicutlural experience ;
* Work in the finance industry in the UK.

**My hobbies**

I like music, especially funk, soul, and jazz. I also do a lot of sport and like very much physical exercise. Finally, I enjoy reading about politics and economics. Do not hesitate to reach out!

**My resume**

```{r resume, out.width="100%", cache=TRUE}
